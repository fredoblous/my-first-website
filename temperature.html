    <p>The temperature of your dough and the temperature used when baking your dough
        is very essential to the end result of your product.
    </p>
    <h3>Dough Temperature</h3>
    <p>The temperature of your dough is very important to the texture of your finished product.
        When dealing with croissant dough, you have to be extra careful with
        the temperature of it. If it gets too warm, the laminated butter will melt
        into the dough. If it is too cold, the butter will harden and may shatter
        when trying to fold the dough.
    </p>
   
    <h3>Baking Temperature</h3>
    <p>When you are ready to bake your dough or are coming up to that
        point, make sure that your oven is preheated to the temperature
        you want to bake your dough in.
    </p>
    <p>If you bake your dough in a still preheating oven, it will
        experience uneven cooking.
    </p>
    <p>Most doughs are baked in 350 degrees F ovens or in 375 degrees F ovens.
        Some doughs such as baguette dough are baked in temperatures at 400 degrees F or higher.
