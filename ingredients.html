    <h2>Types of Flour</h2>
    <p>
        The ingredients you use when making a dough matters a lot.
        As they say, baking is a science. The type of flour you use is the
        most crucial thing to baking. All flour are not the same.
        They have different levels of protein content, are ground
        differently, and use different ingredients.
    </p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->    
    <h3>All-Purpose Flour</h3>
    <p>
        The flour you are probably most familiar with is All-Purpose Flour.
        It is a white, finely ground flour. As the name implies, it can be
        used for any purpose. It contains a protein content of around 11%.
    </p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h3>Cake Flour</h3>
    <p>
        Cake flour is used for making cake batter. It has a lower protein
        content than All-Purpose Flour of around 9%. Cake flour is great
        for baking light and airy goods since it does not develop strong
        gluten.
    </p>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->    
    <h3>Bread Flour</h3>
    <p>
        Bread flour has the highest protein content out of the flours I
        have mentioned so far, a protein content of around 13%. It is best
        for making structually sound dough such as ciabatta and baguettes.
    </p>

    <h3>Specialty Flour</h3>

    </ui>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h3>Protein Content</h3>
   
    <p>The protein content of and flour basically determines how strong
        the gluten of your dough will be when kneaded. For example when
        making baguettes, you would want to use a higher protein flour such as bread flour which has a protein content of around 13%. The
        reason for this is because you want a strong gluten network for
        your baguette dough.
