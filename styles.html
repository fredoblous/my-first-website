    <div class="breadStyles">
    <p style="transform: translateX(10px);">Many places in our world have their own style of baking for example, France. The breads I have shown so far have French origins. France is known for their pastries and pastry-like breads, but they are also known for arguably their most famous bread. The baguette.</p>

    <p class="captionfortwo" style="transform: translateX(10px);">The baguette is widely described as a crusty bread with a soft interior.</p>
    </div>

    <p style="transform: translateX(10px);">Styles of bread however are not restricted to countries and cultures.
        They are reminiscent of the technique used to prepare the dough.
